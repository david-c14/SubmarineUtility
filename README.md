Utility Modules for VCVRack

Important note:

These modules rely on knowledge of VCVRack which goes beyond the published API. The ongoing stability of the code is therefore not guaranteed. At least some of the features of these modules rely on code which is expected to change in future versions of VCVRack, and many other parts are likely to change.

Whilst I intend to try to keep these modules up to date with changes, I can make no guarantees that this will even be possible.

**Module Browser will definitely need to be somewhat rewritten for VCVRack v1.0. It is my intention to do so as soon as possible.**

However, these modules are not designed or intended to form any part of your patch behaviour. They are intended purely as workflow tools. If these modules become incompatible with VCVRack in the future, it should be possible to remove them from the patch without affecting the aural content of the patch.
